# Speech-to-sign-language-translator

The "Speech to Sign Language Translator" is a groundbreaking system designed to transform spoken language into sign language, effectively bridging the communication gap between sign language users and those unfamiliar with it. This tool empowers individuals who use sign language to interact seamlessly with those who do not.

The system works by converting spoken words into text, which is then translated into sign language through a detailed database of gestures. The translated sign language is presented on a screen or mobile device. As a web-based application, it utilizes cloud technology, making it accessible from any device with an internet connection. This demonstrates the potential of cloud computing in creating practical solutions for real-world problems, particularly in overcoming language barriers.
